## Introduction

CREST is a novel modelling language for the definition of Continuous-time, REactive SysTems.
It is a domain-specific language (DSL) targets small cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as home automation systems.
Specifically, it focusses on the flow and transfer of resources within a CPS.
While CREST is a graphical language and its systems can be visualised as CREST diagrams, 
the main form of use is as internal DSL for the Python general purpose programming language.


## Try me !

CREST uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks and [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create, edit and simulate interactive models online.

You can try CREST yourself by clicking on [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stklik/CREST/master) (or on the "launch binder" badge above).

You will find several notebooks that will introduce CREST's
[Syntax & Semantics](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stklik/CREST/master?filepath=Syntax-Semantics.ipynb) and [Simulation](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stklik/CREST/master?filepath=Simulation.ipynb).
You can also just launch the docker container on binder (click the badge) and create a new notebook. 
You can then create and simulate your own models.


## Installation

**Recommended:** Currently the only way to install is to download/clone this repository and use the sources.
The easiest way to run the latest version is to either launch it on Binder (see above),
or use [`repo2docker`](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker).

**Local install:** You can also use CREST locally and install the dependencies manually. See the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for information about the tools and libraries that are used. CREST also requires Microsoft's [Z3Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover) to be installed (including the Python API).


**Soon:** A pip-install is in the pipelines but has been delayed due to publication season :-)
